## Installation

### Recommended: Using a Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Alternative: Global Installation (Not Recommended)

If you prefer to install globally (not recommended for most cases):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python projects and keep your system Python clean.

## Usage

### Development Mode

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Building a Standalone Mac App

To create a standalone Mac application that doesn't require Python:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. **Build the app**:
```bash
python build_app.py
```

3. **Find your app**:
   - Location: `dist/IntelligentToDoList/IntelligentToDoList.app`
   - Double-click to run!

For detailed packaging instructions, see [PACKAGING_GUIDE.md](PACKAGING_GUIDE.md).

The application will open in a desktop window where you can:
- Add new tasks with title, description, priority, due date, and category
- Search tasks using the search bar
- Filter tasks by priority or category
- Toggle task completion
- Edit or delete existing tasks
- View completed tasks (toggle with the "Show Completed" button)

## Data Storage

All tasks are stored locally in `tasks.json` in the application directory. Your data persists between sessions.
